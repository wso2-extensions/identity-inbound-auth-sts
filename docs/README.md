# WS-Trust Connector
The Security Token Service (STS) component of WSO2 Identity Server enables you to configure the generic STS to issue 
claim-based security tokens. A claim-based security token is a common way for applications to acquire and 
authenticate the identity information they need about users inside their organization, in other organizations, and on
 the Internet. This Security Token Service is capable of issuing SAML 1.1 and SAML 2.0 tokens as recommended in 
 WS-Trust and SAML Web Service Token Profile specifications.

**Note:** WS-Trust authentication, which was supported by default in WSO2 Identity Server, will be now provided as a 
connector separated from the product. This will be effective from WSO2 IS 5.11.0 onwards until the WS-Trust 
functionality is reimplemented with a newer version of OpenSAML.
 

## Getting started
- To download the connector, go to [the store](https://store.wso2.com/connector/identity-inbound-auth-sts).
- To get started with the connector, go to [Configuring WS-Trust Security Token Service](config.md).
- Once you have completed your configurations, you can try out WS-Trust Security Token service with WSO2 Identity 
Server.
